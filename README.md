# Tableau Metadata Insights

This repository contains Python scripts and Snowflake SQL queries for extracting, analyzing, and managing Tableau metadata. It is designed to support data teams with auditing dashboards, tracking data lineage, and optimizing Tableau usage across an organization. This approach is currently in beta and uses CSV files saved to OneDrive, and Tableau Prep flows to load to Snowflake, but could be optimized to your unique data stack environment and privileges.
